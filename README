Draft version of a crypto-price alert application, which allows the user to specify a trading pair and a desired price. When such price is reached, the app will both send a mobile notification and email to the specified account. 

Limitations:
- Only supports Binance API
- Email and tokens are hardcoded for now
- UI is very bad
